# Lab_4A_1a_Test_Scores

Write a program that will grade a multiple choice test. Leave the Main class alone for now and start coding in the UnitTest.java file.


### Begin by writing the `StudentAnswer` class
**Class Name:** StudentAnswer

**Instance Variables:**
`String studentName`
`String[] answers`

**Instance Methods**
- **Accessor** methods for `studentName` and `answers`
- a **`toString()`** method to display the student's answers
  
| Name |     |  
|------|-----|
| 1)   | B   | 
| 2)   | D   | 
| 3)   | C   | 

### Rewrite parts of the `UnitTest` class
**Class Name:** UnitTest

**Instance Variables:** 
`String[] answerKey` -- to represent a test answer key. Initialize it according to the following key (it should contain the letters only)


|Answer| Key  |      |      |      |
|------|------|------|------|------|
| 1.B  | 2.D  | 3.C  | 4.A  | 5.E  |
| 6.A  | 7.B  | 8.A  | 9.E  | 10.B |
| 11.B | 12.E | 13.E | 14.D | 15.D |
| 16.A | 17.C | 18.C | 19.A | 20.E |

`StudentAnswer[] studentAns` -- an array of StudentAnswers which will contain a `studentName` String and an array of `answers`.

**Instance Methods:**

- A **constructor** that accepts one argument for. Rewrite this constructor to take in a `fileName`. Use this and a Scanner to read in a `.csv` file which will contain the answers for a number of students. Have the constructor loop through the file and create a `StudentAnswer` object from each line. Initialize the `studentAns` array with the same length as the file (minus the header). Turn each line in the file into a `StudentAnswer` object and place this into the `studentAns` array. 
- **Accessor** method for `studentAns`.

Ammend the following methods to work on an array of `StudentAnswer` objects
- **`totalCorrect()`** that will take in a `studentName` and return the number of correctly answered questions for that student.
- **`totalMistakes()`** method that will return the number of incorrect answers.
- **`isPassing()`** method that will return true if the student passed the exam, or false if the student failed.  A student must correctly answer 14 out of 20 questions in order to pass the test.
- **`toString()`** a method to display the correct answers and the student answers.  It must be in a side by side, 2 column format, with item numbers as follows:

| ANSWER KEY | Student’s Name    |
|------------|-------------------|
| 1) B       | 1) A              |
| 2) D       | 2) A              |
| 3) C       | 3) C              |

Hint:  Create a String and initialize it to the first line of the output using a tab between the phrases instead of spaces (\t).  Create another String for the rest of your output, initializing it to the empty String.  Use a for loop to concatenate onto that string the problem number (which should be one more than the index number) and the String from each array at that index with tabs between the correct answer and the student’s answer (two tabs should do it - \t\t).  Return the first String, followed by a new line (\n), followed by the second String. 

### Complete the `Main` class to test your `UnitTest` class

In the main method:
- Create a Scanner object.
- Use the scanner to read in the `.csv` file

- Create a UnitTest object using the array of students as the parameter.
- Display the following information:
  - The correct answers and any student’s answers (with the student's name) using the toString method.
  - Average Number of Correct Answers: ___ (the blank should be filled in with the appropriate value returned from the appropriate method).
  - Average Number of Mistakes: ___ (the blank should be filled in with the appropriate value returned from the appropriate method).
  - The names of students who PASSED and names of students who FAILED as determined by the appropriate method.
